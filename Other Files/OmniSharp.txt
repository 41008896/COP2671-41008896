Updated VS Code Setup for Unity

    Install .NET SDK:
        Download and install .NET SDK 6.0 or later from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
    Set up VS Code:
        Install VS Code if you haven't already
        Install the C# extension by Microsoft
        Install the Unity extension by Visual Studio Code
    Configure Unity:
        In Unity, go to Edit > Preferences > External Tools
        Set "External Script Editor" to Visual Studio Code
        Ensure "Editor Attaching" is checked
    Generate project files:
        In Unity, go to Assets > Open C# Project
        This should generate the necessary .csproj files
    Open in VS Code:
        Use File > Open Folder in VS Code
        Select the root folder of your Unity project (the one containing the Assets folder)
    OmniSharp configuration:
        Create a file named omnisharp.json in your project's root folder
        Add the following content:

    json

    {
      "msbuild": {
        "useBundledOnly": true
      },
      "RoslynExtensionsOptions": {
        "enableAnalyzersSupport": true
      }
    }

    Restart VS Code

After completing these steps, close and reopen VS Code. You should now see the OmniSharp flame icon in the bottom right corner when you open a C# file.
